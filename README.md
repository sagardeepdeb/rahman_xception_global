# rahman_xception_global_model

The code here is of plain Xception network and global pooling Xception network tried on DDSM-CBIS dataset. The dadaset can be found at the personal goggle drive of sagardeepdeb@gmail.com. 
The features were extracted initially from Xception network and later taken from different convolutional blocks of the same network. 
The classification is initially done with a stacked ensembled classifier. Different kind of machine learning approaches are also tried on. The results are provided with the .ipynb google colab file.
